			<h1>WORK OUT ROUTINES</h1>
			<h2>HOW TO MASTER THE DOUBLE UNDER</h2>
			<h3>This high-intensity CrossFit staple is a twofer of conditioning and fat burning.</h3>
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<img src="img/1109-jump-rope_0.jpg" class="img-responsive">
					<h4>HOW TO: DOUBLE UNDERS:</h4>
						<ul>
							<strong><li>First, measure your rope. Put the rope under one foot and raise both handles. They should stop right at your armpits.</li>
							<li>“Glue” your elbows to your sides. Practice this first with single unders.</li>
							<li>Jump with an upright torso. Stay as tall as possible, bound off your toes using your calves, and keep your toes in front of your body.</li>
							<li>Turn the rope by rotating only at the wrists (not the elbows or shoulders). Again, you can practice this by doing single unders.</li>
							<li>To go from single unders to double unders, jump higher and rotate your wrists faster.</li></strong>
						</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p id="para1">Jumping rope as it’s typically done (aka “single unders”) is a moderate-intensity form of cardio that you could probably do continuously for a few minutes if you really wanted to. Double unders, on the other hand, are decidedly high-intensity and about the closest thing you can get to an all-out running sprint without having to travel forward. If you hate jumping rope, you’ll doubly hate double unders. The suck factor, however, is directly proportional to the benefits offered.
					<br>
					<br>
					“Double unders are a great tool to improve coordination and speed,” says Bill Shiffler, C.S.C.S., CF-L1, owner of CrossFit Renaissance in Philadelphia (renaissancephysique.net). “Once you’ve mastered the skill element, they also serve as a phenomenal conditioning and HIIT exercise because of the higher power output of the movement compared with single unders.”</p>
					<br>
					<p id="para2">You don’t have to be a gifted athlete to do double unders—just an ambitious one who seeks the highest intensity level possible to maximize calorie and fat burning. Before you jump headfirst into double unders, heed these tips.<p>

					<h4>DIRECTIONS:</h4>
					<ul><strong>
						<li>Perform 3–5 rounds.</li>
						<li>Perform this workout either after lifting weights or by itself on a cardio day.</li>
						<li>Choose rounds and reps based on your current fitness level.</li>
						<li>Did you know: Jumping rope burns more than 10 calories per minute.</li></strong>

			<h2>ARE YOU AS FIT AS A MILITARY ATHLETE?</h2>
			<h3>Put yourself through the paces of this physically demanding workout, designed to help you test your relative strength.</h3>
			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<img src="img/Rope-Climb-Military-Army-1109.jpg" class="img-responsive">

			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<p id="para3">Rob Shaul, the founder of Military Athlete, couldn’t give a rip about your tricked out biceps or Oak-like chest. As a trainer of tactical athletes—as well as those who simply aspire to have military-grade conditioning—he is much more concerned about what you can do with all that muscle.
				<br>
				“Relative strength refers to strength per your individual bodyweight,” he says. “I believe relative strength, not maximal strength (or the most you can lift), is most important for military, law enforcement, and rescue athletes because you must travel over ground and carry your engine. We’re not training powerlifters or bodybuilders here. You’ve got to be able to run, climb, sprint, jump, and move.”
				<br>
				The good news is that those are all traits that benefit everyone, regardless of how jacked you want your physique to be. All of those things, when trained regularly, can help as much with body composition as they can with pure athleticism.
				<br>
				 Shaul has devised a test that he feels is powerfully indicative of where you stand with your own levels of relative strength. If you’re the least bit curious as to where you stack up against the M&F community, post your (honest) results in the comments section below.<p>
